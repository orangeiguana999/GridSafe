Self-driving / [Automated Safety System]

- Scenario-focused
  - Car vs. person (moving/stationary)
  - Car vs. vehicle (moving/stationary)
  - Car vs. object (stationary/moving)
  - Driver unusual behavior / non-sober
  - Driver unconscious

- Interoperability 
  - Car locations / coordinates
  - Car speed
  - Car acceleration
  - Car direction
  - Car distance from other cars/vehicles/objects/people
  - Car position in road/lane
  - Car distance from stop/intersection
  - Road angle
  - Road width
  - Road friction/texture

- Actions
  - Slow-down/stop at distance/speed/acceleration/direction (Frequency level 3 (common))
  - Steering adjustment at distance/speed/acceleration/direction (Frequency level 2 (somewhat common))
  - Accelerate at distance/speed/acceleration/direction behind (Frequency level 1 (rare))

- Implementation
  - New models
  - Old models retroactive installation
  - Mandate
